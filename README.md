Use
  Configure Constants.java to add each motor you want to test, corresponding with it's CAN ID, to the MotorIDs enum.  The name doesn't matter, as shuffle board UI is laveled with the motor's ID.  Once you've done that, open shuffleboard and enable the robot.  Drag out each "MotorX" property from preferences, where X is the motor's ID, as well as corresponding RPM values.  The booleans are user controlled and represent selection for setting (true means it will be affected by changes).  RPM, P, I, D, and V properties are the configs that will be applied when Set RPM of Enabled is pressed (while robot is enabled) to all IDs that are set to enabled.  Stop All Motors stops all registered motors indiscriminantly, whether enabled or not.
